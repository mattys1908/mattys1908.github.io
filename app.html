        <main><h2>Web Application Architecture</h2><p>The structural layout and organization of the elements necessary to the operation of web-based software applications is referred to as web application architecture. It includes a variety of technologies and layers that interact to provide seamless user experiences.
            The presentation layer, which controls the user interface and how content is displayed, the application logic layer, which handles user requests and business logic, and the data storage layer, which controls data storage and retrieval, are the three main parts of a web application architecture.
            Web application design is based on the client-server model, in which clients (often web browsers) ask servers for resources, the servers handle these requests, and the clients receive the necessary responses.
            A wide range of frameworks and technologies are frequently used in contemporary web application architectures. These comprise databases (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB) for data storing and retrieval, front-end frameworks (such as React, Angular, or Vue.js) for building interactive user interfaces, and back-end frameworks (such as Django, Ruby on Rails, or Node.js) for managing application logic.
            The separation of applications into smaller, independent services that communicate over APIs is known as microservices architecture. Scalability, flexibility, and maintenance are all improved by this method.
            Scalable infrastructure is offered by cloud computing platforms and services like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for hosting web applications.
            Security is a crucial factor that involves taking actions to protect user data and application integrity, such as encryption, authentication, and authorisation.
            The design, development, and deployment of modern applications are shaped by the web application architecture, which is always changing to satisfy the rising demands of user experience, performance, and security.</p>
            <p>A Web Application Architecture shows a layout with all software components, like your typical databases, and how they interact with each other. This refers to how data gets delivered through HTTP and makes sure the client-side server and the backend server is able to understand them. Some components of Web Application Architecture are web browsers, web servers and database servers. These are the three core components every web application has.
                <ul>
                    <li>Web browser is the key component that is the most interactive with the users of web browsers. It receives input from the user and manages the presentation logic whilst controlling user interactions. Web browsers are also known as the client-side components. </li>
                    <li>Web Server is also known as the backend component, or the server-side component handles the business logic and processes the user requests by routing the requests to the right component and managing the entire application operations. It can run and oversee requests from a wide variety of clients.</li>
                    <li>Database Server: The database server provides the required data for the application. It handles data-related tasks. In a multi-tiered architecture, database servers can manage business logic with the help of stored procedures.
