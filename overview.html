        <main><h2>Overview Of The World Wide Web</h2><p>The World Wide Web (WWW), also referred to as the web or the internet, is an international information system that serves as a network of connected digital resources. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, created it in 1989, and since then it has completely changed how information is shared, transmitted, and accessed.
            Hyperlinks, which are clickable connections that let users move between different web pages, documents, photos, videos, and other multimedia information, are the basis for how the internet works. Web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari can be used to access these resources, which are kept on servers across the globe.
            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure material, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style it, and JavaScript is used to provide interaction. The complexity and function of websites can vary greatly, from straightforward personal blogs to complicated e-commerce systems and sizable informational databases.
            The web has had a significant impact on society, business, education, and communication, promoting worldwide connectedness and democratizing information access. However, it has also sparked worries about digital divide, misinformation, security, and privacy. Artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and immersive experiences are defining the future of the web as it continues to develop, further obfuscating the boundary between the virtual and physical worlds.</p>
            <p>the World Wide Web- a.k.a WWW is all the public websites and web pages where people, also known as users, can access on any computing device through the internet. All web pages and documents are interlinked with one another through various hyperlinks the users can click on to access information in various formats. Those formats include text, images, videos, and audio files. (ScienceMediaMuseum, 2020)
                It is known that the World Wide Web is not similar to the internet, but it is rather part of the internet. The WWW has three different components which allows users to access different resources from the internet. This means that the WWW is one giant E-book, except each page of the book is hosted through different servers worldwide. 
                The “pages” are key components or otherwise stated, building blocks of the WWW are all linked through hyperlinks, the hyperlinks give the user access from one spot in a specific type of metadata to another spot in a document, website, web page, or any type of information.
