        <main><h2>Internet Protocols</h2><p>Internet protocols are a set of guidelines and standards that control how information is sent over the internet, received, and processed. These protocols guarantee smooth communication and compatibility among various networks and devices.
            TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the most basic protocol suite. Data segmentation, reassembly, and error checking are handled by TCP, ensuring dependable and well-organized data delivery. Data packets can navigate different networks thanks to IP, which controls addressing and routing.
            The transport of web page content between web servers and browsers is facilitated by the HTTP (Hypertext transport technology), a key technology for the World Wide Web. To safeguard the security and privacy of data, HTTPS (HTTP Secure) adds an encryption layer.
            Email retrieval is controlled by POP3 (Post Office Protocol) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), while email transmission is governed by SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
            Files can be sent between computers via the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) protocol, and the DNS (Domain Name System) converts domain names into IP addresses for effective web addressing.
            Other prominent protocols are DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for dynamically allocating IP addresses and SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) for managing and monitoring network devices.
            Newer protocols have been created as a result of the development of the internet, including IPv6, which offers a bigger address space, and protocols for real-time communication (like VoIP) and multimedia streaming (like RTP).
            The huge number of online services and experiences that have become essential to our digital lives are made possible by internet protocols, which serve as the fundamental building block of contemporary connectedness.</p>
            <p>Internet protocols form the backbone of communication on the World Wide Web. They enable data exchange between devices, ensuring seamless connectivity and interaction. This document aims to explain the concept of Internet protocols, their significance, and how they facilitate online communication. Internet protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted, received, and interpreted over the internet. Data being sent between two network devices is divided into smaller packets by the underlying hardware and software. There are many types of Internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SFTP etc. Below is an explanation for the above-mentioned internet protocols. (kumarankit4685, 2023)
                <ul>
                    <li>HTTP- Hyper Text transfer protocol is used to transfer many hypertexts over the internet. It defines how information should be formatted and transmitted. When users open up browsers, they unintentionally use the HTTP protocol as this protocol is used to share all sorts of multimedia.</li>
                    <li>FTP- File Transfer Protocol is used when files are being transferred from one system to the other. This action works off the server-client model- a bigger server that partitions workload and resources to servers, which is the clients (syedmodassirali, 2022)- when a machine wants to send/receive files, to/from another machine, the the protocol sets up a connection between the two and authenticates each other with an ID and password. </li>
                    <li>SFTP- Secure File Transfer Protocol is also known as FTP over Secure Shell as it encrypts both the commands given and data received while the transmission is going. SFTP acts as an extension to SSH and encrypts files and data then sends them over a secure network.  (kumarankit4685, 2023)</li>
