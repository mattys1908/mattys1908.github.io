        <main><h2>Evolution Of The Internet</h2><p>Communication, information exchange, and daily life have all changed as a result of the internet's dynamic evolution. The development of the internet accelerated after the creation of the ARPANET in the late 1960s, a network intended for military and research communication. The idea of packet switching first came into existence in the 1970s, laying the groundwork for effective data transmission via networks.
            Standardized communication protocols like TCP/IP were established in the 1980s, allowing various networks to link with ease and giving rise to the word "internet" to denote this vast network of networks. The World Wide Web (WWW), on the other hand, didn't fundamentally alter how usable and accessible the internet was until the 1990s. The creation of hyperlinks by Tim Berners-Lee allowed users to move between interconnected web pages, which greatly increased online content and user engagement.
            With the rise of e-commerce, social media, and search engines in the 2000s, the internet's influence grew stronger. The rise of mobile technologies in the 2010s ushered in the mobile internet era, which increased connectivity to an even greater extent. With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), a variety of things and devices—from wearable technology to smart appliances—now have internet connectivity.
            With the investigation of cutting-edge technologies like 5G, AI, and blockchain, the development of the internet continues today. These advancements promise to transform the internet's capabilities, speed, security, and prospective uses, providing a glimpse into a future in which the internet will have a more significant impact on society, communication, business, and culture.</p>
            <p>During the time of the cold war in the 1950s, USA needed a form of communication which would not be affected by any of the attacks from the Soviet Union. In this period of time, computers were large, expensive machines operated by the military and staff from university. The machines were rare to find and if there was one to use, researchers would need to travel around in order to use it. This is when ‘time-sharing’ was created. This method allowed users to simultaneously access a mainframe computer through a series of terminals. Having difficulty in using this lead various STEM- Science, Technology, Engineering, Math- workers to the idea or conceptualisation of or having a possibly large computer network. (ScienceMediaMuseum, 2020)
                The growth of the internet started between the years 1986 and 1997 where the network grew from only 2000 hosts, to 30000. The use of the internet in these years were used to send messages, send files or even read the daily news. It was easy to use until Berners-Lee drew up a proposal in 1989 to CERN about structuring and linking all of his information available to the CERN network making it easy to access. This then sparked the idea for the World Wide Web. From there the launching of Mosaic in 1993 allowed non-academics and other people to discover that they had the ability to create their own HTML web pages. This caused the effect of having only 130 websites in 1993 to having over 100,000 websites in 1996.  By the year of 1995, the internet and the world wide web was established with phenomena such as Netscape navigator. This was the most popular browser at the time with around 10 million users across the globe. The most popular browsers being used today is chrome, Firefox, edge, apple safari etc. (ScienceMediaMuseum, 2020)
