        <main><h2>WWW vs The Internet</h2><p>Although they are distinct ideas, the World Wide Web (WWW) and the internet are related. The internet is a sizable, linked global network of gadgets and computers that use established protocols to communicate with one another. Beyond only web browsing, it includes a broad range of technologies and services like email, file sharing, online gaming, and more. With the advent of protocols like TCP/IP, the ARPANET established the groundwork for the internet in the 1960s.
            The World Wide Web, on the other hand, is a particular subset of the internet and was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s. It is a network of online resources and information that are linked together. The web depends on technologies like HTML for content structuring, HTTP for data transfer, and web browsers for information presentation. Users can access information and multimedia hosted on worldwide servers by navigating over hyperlinks.
            In essence, the World Wide Web provides the user-friendly interface and multimedia content delivery system that most people identify with their online experiences, while the internet provides the infrastructure and network connectivity. The World Wide Web is a well-known application that functions within this larger internet ecosystem, which enables a variety of services and technologies to function.</p>
        <p>The world wide web are the pages you see when you're at a device and you're online. Whereas the internet the connected network of computers that the web works on. Emails and files travel across the internet to their desired destinations. Think of the internet as the roads that connect towns and cities together. The world wide web contains the things you see on the roads like houses and shops. The vehicles that travel those roads is the data that moves around - some go between websites and others will be transferring your emails or files across the internet, separately from the web. (BBC, 2019)
            A key importance about their differences is that the internet refers to any hardware used whereas the World Wide Web is software based. The internet is the network that connects all networks. The way the internet connects through the network is with copper wires and, wireless networks or fibre optics. The web is just a large group of web pages in a website that are linked with each other. (Lithmee, 2018)
            The internet uses the IP protocol for the communication between data. The network consists of multiple computing devices and each device having a unique IP protocol which can be used to identify the device. It allows for the exchange of resources and information instantly. The internet is known as a public network and public networks allow anyone to access the internet. On the other hand, the world wide web is an application that runs on the internet which refers to a large collection of web pages. As mentioned above, the web is linked with each other, each web page is linked through hyperlinks, which means users can move from one page and to another web page. The web uses the http protocol, which helps with accessing websites and pages. The HTTP is set out to display any images, text, audio and all sorts of multimedia available on the WWW.
