        <main><h2>History Of the Internet</h2><p>Beginning with the creation of ARPANET in the late 1960s, the history of the internet spans several decades. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defence financed the creation of the ARPANET, a network of computers that enables researchers to share data and resources.
            The idea of packet switching first came into existence in the 1970s, allowing data to be divided into small packets and transferred across numerous pathways, improving network resilience. A network of interconnected networks is what the name internet refers to.
            TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) became the accepted communication protocol in the 1980s, enabling smooth communication between various networks. This created the framework for the contemporary internet.
            Tim Berners-Lee's creation of the World Wide Web, which allowed users to access information through hyperlinked web pages, represented a turning point in the 1990s. The user-friendly design of the web contributed to its widespread acceptance.
            The dot-com boom burst in the early 2000s, yet despite this, the internet kept expanding because to the emergence of social media, online shopping, and search engines.
            The internet has shaped communication, commerce, education, and entertainment on a worldwide scale in the modern world. Rapid technological improvements throughout its history, such as the spread of mobile devices, broadband, and the Internet of Things (IoT), have promised an expanding future for the internet's reach and influence.</p> 
            <p>During the time of the cold war in the 1950s, USA needed a form of communication which would not be affected by any of the attacks from the Soviet Union. In this period of time, computers were large, expensive machines operated by the military and staff from university. The machines were rare to find and if there was one to use, researchers would need to travel around in order to use it. This is when ‘time-sharing’ was created. This method allowed users to simultaneously access a mainframe computer through a series of terminals. Having difficulty in using this lead various STEM- Science, Technology, Engineering, Math- workers to the idea or conceptualisation of or having a possibly large computer network. (ScienceMediaMuseum, 2020)
                The various inventors of the internet namely:
            <ul> 
                <li>Paul Baran (1926–2011), the engineer who overlapped ARPA’s research.</li>
                <li>Lawrence Roberts (1937–2018), chief scientist at ARPA</li>
                <li>Leonard Kleinrock (1934–), who helped in creating a distributed network with Roberts.</li>
                <li>Donald Davies (1924–2000), who designed similar technology in the time of Roberts and Kleinrock</li>
                <li>Bob Kahn (1938-) and Vint Cerf (1943-), who created the IP addresses which evolved ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network- first computer network used in 1969. (Wright, 2023)) which into the internet being used in daily life.</li>
            </ul>
                •	 Paul Mockapetris (1948–) and Jon Postel (1943–98), the inventors of the DNS, otherwise known as the ‘phonebook of the internet’. The Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses which lets browsers to get to different websites and other resources. (Fortinet, 2023). 
                •	Tim-Berners-Lee (1955-), the creator of the WWW and the developer of the many principles used in websites such as, HTML, HTTPS, URL’s and web browsers. 
                •	and finally, Mark Andreessen (1971-) who created the very first widely used web browser, Mosaic.
                The growth of the internet started between the years 1986 and 1997 where the network grew from only 2000 hosts, to 30000. The use of the internet in these years were used to send messages, send files or even read the daily news. It was easy to use until Berners-Lee drew up a proposal in 1989 to CERN about structuring and linking all of his information available to the CERN network making it easy to access. This then sparked the idea for the World Wide Web. From there the launching of Mosaic in 1993 allowed non-academics and other people to discover that they had the ability to create their own HTML web pages. This caused the effect of having only 130 websites in 1993 to having over 100,000 websites in 1996.  By the year of 1995, the internet and the world wide web was established with phenomena such as Netscape navigator. This was the most popular browser at the time with around 10 million users across the globe. The most popular browsers being used today is chrome, Firefox, edge, apple safari etc. (ScienceMediaMuseum, 2020)
